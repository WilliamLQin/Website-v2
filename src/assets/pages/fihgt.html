            Fihgt is a local two player fighting game with a variety of characters! <br>
            It runs as a standalone application on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. <br>
            "A wacky and fun fighting game for two players!" <br>
            <br>
            The project was created in Unity, the code was programmed in C#, and assets were created using AESprite. <br>
            <br>
            Fihgt was a short side project that was started with a friend during the winter break. <br>
            We are now working on a new project with a bigger scope: <a href="plant">Plant</a>! <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Play Fihgt now! <br>
