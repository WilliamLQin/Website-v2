            Pop MIDI is a pop can music box that can play MIDI files! <br>
            The hardware creation is to be used with a Python script and an ArduinoC script. <br>
            "This instrument brings a new sense of fun and uniqueness with its cool resonating sound and eco-friendly nature!" <br>
            <br>
            Hardware consists of an Arduino, several servos, pop cans, stirring sticks, duct tape, and cardboard boxes. <br>
            The hardware was programmed in ArduinoC and the MIDI file reader was programmed in Python. <br>
            <br>
            Pop MIDI was created at Cipher Local Hack Day, a 12-hour hackathon in Brampton. <br>
            Our team won 1<sup>st</sup> Place with a Mentor! <br>
