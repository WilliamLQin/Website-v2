            I am a registered participant of <em>FIRST</em>&reg; Robotics Competition! <br>
            <br>
            Currently, I am a programmer of <a href="http://team4308.ca">FRC Team 4308</a>. <br>
            <br>
            As a programmer, I program the autonomous and teleoperated driver controls for the robot, 
            as well as create applications to serve the team. I also am a member of the team, and we compete 
            against other robots in a special "sport" that changes theme every year! <br>

            In the past, I was a programmer of <a href="http://team1325.com">FRC Team 1325</a> for the
            2016 and 2017 seasons. During my time on this team, I led the team scouting initiative 
            and deployed a special compiler that would visualize the data collected by the team! <br>
            <br>
            The scouting compiler was a web application and database for recording and viewing information on 
            other teams at <em>FIRST</em> Steamworks competitions. It was extensively used for important insights 
            on other teams prior to competitions and for alliance selections. <br>
            <br>
            The project was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase. <br>
