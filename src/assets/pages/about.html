            I am a 16 year-old high school student, developer, and creator! <br>
            <br>
            I am pursuing my passion for technology and creation by experimenting with new technologies and by learning new skills! <br>
            <br>
            I am always eager to learn new things, take opportunities to grow, and tackle difficult problems.

            Since I was 9 years old, I have been applying my programming skills to develop interesting games, create problem solving 
            applications, prototype hardware, and design websites. The very first programming language I learned was ActionScript, a 
            language used in Macromedia Flash (today, it is known as Adobe Animate). My early journey through learning programming 
            languages was a rough and unguided one—I only had examples to learn from—but despite all odds, I made exciting games that
            I brought to school for my peers and I to play! <br>
            <br>
            Today, I use and work with many different programming languages and tools! So far, I have...
            <ul>
                <li>...made games in Unity with C#</li>
                <li>...created websites using Angular, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, and TypeScript or JavaScript</li>
                <li>...developed Android applications in Android Studio with Java</li>
                <li>...processed data using Python</li>
                <li>...tracked objects with computer vision and artificial intelligence</li>
                <li>...programmed robots in Eclipse with Java</li>
                <li>...created virtual reality experiences using Google Cardboard</li>
                <li>...made smart (IoT) devices with Arduino</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
