            Lightboard Creator is an interface for creating lightboard messages to be displayed on traffic signs! <br>
            It runs as a standalone application on Windows. <br>
            <br>
            The project was created in Visuasl Studio and programmed in C#. <br>
            <br>
            Lightboard Creator was one of the major projects that I worked on as a software developer intern at D&amp;R Electronics Co. Ltd. <br>
            It is now being used to rapidly create and deploy various messages for the company's lightboards. <br>
