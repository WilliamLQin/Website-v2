            Space Jousting is an action-packed two-player game where you try to strike your opponent at their weak spots! <br>
            It runs as a standalone application on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. <br>
            <br>
            The project was created in Unity and programmed in C#. <br>
            <br>
            Space Jousting was created at Cipher Snowday '17, a 12-hour hackathon in Brampton. <br>
            It was my first time mentoring for a team, and our team won 2<sup>nd</sup> Place! <br>
            <br>
