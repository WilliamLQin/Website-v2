            CPR-VR is a virtual reality simulator for basic CPR training! <br>
            It runs as a standalone application on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. <br>
            "CPR-VR gamifies a basic CPR procedure, making it easily accessible with Google Cardboard!" <br>
            <br>
            The project was created in Unity, the code was programmed in C#, 
            the hardware was powered by Google Cardboard and Leap Motion, and the assets were created in SketchUp. <br>
            <br>
            CPR-VR was created at UofTHacks IV, a 36-hour hackathon at the University of Toronto. <br>
            Our team of four won Top 10 Overall Hack! <br>
