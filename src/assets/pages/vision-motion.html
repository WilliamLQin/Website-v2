            Vision Motion is a motion sensor mobile app that uses the camera to track an object and graph position, velocity, and acceleration. <br>
            It runs as an Android application. <br>
            "Track and graph the motion of anything." <br>
            <br>
            The project was built in Android Studio and programmed in Java. <br>
            <br>
            Vision Motion was originally created at THacks2, a 24-hour hackathon at the University of Toronto. <br>
            Later, I continued working on the project and published it on the Google Play Store! <br>
            It has been used in physics classrooms to enhance learning! <br>
