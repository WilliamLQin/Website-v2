            Think Tank is a game that uses your brain waves to control a tank! <br>
            It runs as a standalone application on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux, and is to be used with the Muse Headband and SDK. <br>
            "Train your concentration and lose yourself in this immersive telepathic co-op tank game!" <br>
            <br>
            The project was built in Unity and programmed in C#. <br>
            <br>
            Think Tank was created at Electric City Hacks 2, a 36-hour hackathon at Trent University. <br>
            Our team won Top 6 Overall Hack, Best Domain Name, and the Wolfram One Award! <br>
