            Stux is an engaging and minimalist stacking game! <br>
            It runs as an iOS application. <br>
            "Balance blocks in this new and incredible arcade stacker!" <br>
            <br>
            The project was created in Xcode and programmed in Objective-C. <br>
            <br>
            Stux was my second programming project that I launched on the iOS App Store! <br>
            It was downloaded over 300 times, and made over 1500 ad impressions! <br>
            <br>
            Unfortunately, Stux can't be found on the App Store anymore. <br>
