            Laser Field is a laser bounding and survival mobile game! <br>
            It runs as an iOS application. <br>
            "Dodge lasers in this new and amazing bounding game!" <br>
            <br>
            The project was created in Xcode and programmed in Objective-C. <br>
            <br>
            Laser Field was my very first programming project that I launched on the iOS App Store! <br>
            It was downloaded over 150 times, and made over 350 ad impressions! <br>
            <br>
            Unfortunately, Laser Field can't be found on the App Store anymore. <br>
